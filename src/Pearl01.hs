-- Problem 1: smallest natural number not in a given finite set X of natural numbers.
--  The key fact for both the array-based and divide and conquer solutions
--  is that not every number in the range [0 .. length xs] can be in xs. Thus the
--  smallest number not in xs is the smallest number not in filter (â‰¤ n)xs, where
--  n = length xs.
